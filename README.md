# Ticket Master
This site was developed for the pharmacy technicians at the Mountain Home VAMC. This
site takes a starting input (the next ticket in the reem) and then displays the tickets
sequentially, relative to the starting input. The display also contains a timestamp of
the time the ticket was added to the queue, as well as an elapsed wait time of the oldest
ticket.

## How To Use
- Fill the empty fields then click the submit button
- Click the next patient button to add the next ticket to the queue
- To remove a ticket, simply hover over the ticket you wish to remove and click the left mouse button

## Some background
Starting April 2022, the pharmacy waiting room began rennovations to make use of the abnormal amount of space. 
The idea was to use half of the original space for the pharmacy waiting room, and the other half for office space.
During said time (~1yr 2mo), our [Qmatic](https://www.qmatic.com/) lobby manager was disabled and we had to station a technician
in the hallway just outside of the pharmacy to manage the lobby. Originally we had to write down each ticket
issued and keep track of it on paper. This process was very tedious and I wanted to find an easier way to do it, thus the birth of this
little project.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

This site was developed while I was working in the hallway, handing out tickets. I chose to build it from scratch
using these three technologies as a challenge to myself. I wanted to see if I could build something user-friendly and functional using only what
was available to me on my work computer.
